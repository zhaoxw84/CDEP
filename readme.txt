/* This folder contains the matlab codes for the experiments in paper "A community detection algorithm based on graph compression for large-scale social networks¡± (by X.W. Zhao, J.Y. Liang and J. Wang, Information Sciences, under review). */

All the files are introduced below:
CDEPTest.m:   execute community detection by using the proposed CDEP algorithm and measure the results.
CDEP.m:       main function of the proposed CDEP
nmi.m:       a function that calculate the  normalized mutual information between the community detection results and ground-truth. 
modularity_metric.m:  a function for calculating the modularity of the results.

 
How to execute the experiment are introduced below:
1. Input the target data set and labels (if exist) in CDEPTest.m 
2. Execute CDEPTest.m.
3. Experimental results will be displayed automatically.
